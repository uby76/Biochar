# Biochar reshapes soil bacterial community composition and survival strategies: a meta-analysis revealing trade-offs between microbial stability and functional complexity
As a promising strategy for improving soil health and mitigating climate change, biochar has received increasing attention in recent years. However, findings regarding its microbial effects are often context-dependent, and the complex impacts of biochar on soil microbial communities remain inadequately understood. Here, we integrated 843 samples of 16 S rRNA sequencing data from 24 independent studies, utilizing machine learning and co-occurrence network analysis to evaluate general patterns and mechanisms by which biochar alters bacteria community composition and survival strategies. Overall, biochar significantly increased soil organic C, total N, pH, and reduced bulk density, which in turn affected microbial communities. While biochar addition did not notably alter bacterial α-diversity (Shannon index or species richness), it significantly changed β-diversity, indicating that biochar addition altered microbial community composition. Biochar changed community composition and survival strategies by reducing the oligotroph/copiotroph ratio, favouring copiotrophs groups (e.g., Bacteroidota). K-strategists (e.g., Planctomycetota) were reduced by biochar, potentially due to increased nutrient availability and increased competition. Model selection analysis identified that soil physicochemical properties were key drivers of α-diversity, while climate variables were the main factors influencing β-diversity. Biochar properties represented key factors influencing changes in microbial survival strategy. Machine learning identified 138 biomarker genera, with biochar-treated soils showing an increase in Pseudomonadota. Co-occurrence network analysis indicated that biochar increased microbial stability, but reduced network complexity, suggesting a trade-off between resilience and functional redundancy following biochar addition. These findings provide new insights into how biochar influences the composition and ecological functions of soil bacterial communities and offer theoretical support for its scientific application in sustainable soil management.
